Your website, %s, may have been broken in to.

Someone just logged in using the following components. Prior to that, some combination of those components were a part of 4 failed attempts to log in during the past 60 minutes:


Component                    Count     Value from Current Attempt
------------------------     -----     --------------------------------
Network IP                       0     1.2.33
Username                         4     test
Password MD5                     %d    %s

The user's current IP address is one they have verified with your site in the past.  Therefore, the user will NOT be required to confirm their identity via the password reset process.  An email will be sent to them, just in case this actually was a breach.
